100 Days of Python - Day 004 Summary:

On the fourth day of my 100-day Python challenge, I explored key concepts related to randomisation, lists, and how to work with both in Python:

1. Randomisation:
   - Learned how to use the `random` module to generate random numbers.
   - Used `randint()` to generate random integers within a specified range.
   - Explored random floating-point numbers using `random.random()` and `random.uniform()` for custom ranges.

2. Coin Flip Simulation:
   - Created a simple program to simulate a coin flip using randomisation, where it randomly prints "Heads" or "Tails".

3. Working with Lists:
   - Created and accessed elements in a list by index (both positive and negative indices).
   - Practiced modifying and appending items to a list using indexing and the `append()` method.

4. Banker Roulette Project:
   - Wrote a program that picks a random friend from a list of names using randomisation, simulating a "Banker Roulette" scenario.

5. List Length and Nested Lists:
   - Used the `len()` function to determine the length of a list.
   - Experimented with nesting lists within other lists, creating a structure of fruits and vegetables.

6. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Project:
   - Developed a Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user can choose between rock, paper, or scissors.
   - Used randomisation for the computer's choice and conditional logic to determine the outcome of the game (win, lose, or draw).
   - Implemented ASCII art for a fun representation of each choice in the game.
