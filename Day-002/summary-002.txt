100 Days of Python - Day 002 Summary:

On the second day of my 100-day Python challenge, I deepened my understanding of Python’s core concepts:

1. Primitive Data Types:
   - Strings: Learned that strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes and how to identify their type using the `type()` function.
   - Integers: Explored whole numbers (positive or negative) without decimals and their type.
   - Floats: Examined fractional numbers that include decimals, identifying them using `type()`.
   - Booleans: Understood Boolean values, which can be either `True` or `False`.

2. Type Errors and Conversion:
   - Type Errors: Encountered and resolved errors caused by using incorrect data types, especially when working with functions like `len()`.
   - Type Conversion: Practiced converting between data types using functions like `int()`, `float()`, and `str()` to ensure correct operations.

3. Mathematical Operators:
   - PEMDAS: Learned Python’s order of operations (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction) and practiced solving expressions using these rules.
   - Expression Modification: Modified arithmetic expressions to achieve specific results by adjusting operator precedence with parentheses.

4. Number Manipulation:
   - BMI Calculation: Calculated Body Mass Index (BMI) using weight and height, and practiced rounding the result using the `round()` function.
   - Rounding: Used `round()` to round numbers to the nearest whole number or specified decimal places.
   - Assignment Operators: Simplified arithmetic operations on variables using operators like `+=`, `-=`, etc.
   - f-Strings: Utilized f-strings for efficient string formatting, inserting variables and expressions directly into strings.

This day reinforced my knowledge of Python’s basic data types, handling errors, performing mathematical operations, and formatting outputs—key skills for more advanced programming.
