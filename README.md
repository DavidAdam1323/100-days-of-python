# 100 Days of Python Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Python repository! This project documents my journey of learning Python over the next 100 days, where I'll be focusing on various aspects of the language and its applications, particularly in full-stack development.

## Repository Structure

Each day of the challenge is organized into its own folder, from **Day-001** to **Day-100**. Inside each folder, you'll find:

- **Code**: Python scripts and projects I worked on that day.
- **Notes**: Key concepts and takeaways from my learning.

## Purpose

This challenge is designed to expand my skills in Python and prepare me for full-stack development. By committing to daily practice and documentation, I aim to build a strong foundation in Python programming, and ultimately enhance my ability to develop complete applications.

Feel free to follow along, provide feedback, or join me in the challenge!
