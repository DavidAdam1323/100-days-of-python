100 Days of Python - Day 001 Summary:

On the first day of my 100-day Python challenge, I focused on foundational concepts in Python:

1. Printing:
   - Learned how to use the print() function to display messages.
   - Practiced basic string output, including multiple lines using the newline character (\n).

2. String Manipulation:
   - Explored how to concatenate strings using the + operator.
   - Formatted outputs by adding spaces between concatenated strings.

3. User Input:
   - Used the input() function to collect data from the user and integrate it into your output.

4. Variables:
   - Captured user input in variables, calculated the length of a string using len(), and displayed the result.
   - Gained an understanding of how to store and reuse data in Python.

5. Variable Naming:
   - Learned the rules of proper variable naming in Python, ensuring descriptive, readable, and valid names.

6. Project: Band Name Generator:
   - Created a simple and fun project where you collected the user's city and pet name to generate a custom band name.
