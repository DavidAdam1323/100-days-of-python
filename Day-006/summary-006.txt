100 Days of Python - Day 006 Summary:

On Day 6 of my Python challenge, I explored the concepts of functions and while loops, using them to create reusable code and handle repetitive tasks.

1. Functions:
   - Defined simple functions to wrap blocks of code, making the code reusable and organized.
   - Learned how to pass arguments to functions, allowing dynamic inputs to control the output.
   - Demonstrated this by creating a function that takes a username and a greeting as arguments and outputs a personalized message.
   - Collected input from users through the `input()` function.
   - Used this input within functions to provide customized responses and store the values in a dictionary for easier management.

2. List and String Manipulation:
   - Created a function `list_benefits()` that returns a list of strings describing the advantages of using functions.
   - Implemented a `build_sentence()` function to append each string with "is a benefit of functions!" and displayed the benefits using a loop.

3. While Loops:
   - Practiced the use of `while` loops to repeatedly prompt for input until the desired condition was met.
   - Created loops that checked for valid names, ages (above 18), and numbers (between 1 and 10), giving feedback when the input was incorrect.
   
4. Project: Guess the Number Game:
   - Developed a simple "Guess the Number" game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 20, and the player has to guess it.
   - Provided hints like "Too low!" or "Too high!" after each guess, and the game continued until the correct number was guessed.
   - Implemented a replay feature allowing the player to play multiple rounds of the game until they choose to exit.
